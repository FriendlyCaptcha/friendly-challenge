# Friendly Captcha Documentation

Friendly Captcha is a system for preventing spam on your website.  You can add the **Friendly Captcha widget** to your web app to fight spam, with little impact to the user experience.

Friendly Captcha sends the user a cryptographic puzzle that takes the user's device a few seconds to solve, the user doesn't have to do anything.

This documentation will show you how to integrate Friendly Captcha into your website. If you wish to learn more about Friendly Captcha, visit the [**Friendly Captcha website**](https://friendlycaptcha.com).
