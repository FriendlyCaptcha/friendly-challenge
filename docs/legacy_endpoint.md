# Updating from the legacy endpoint

Since April 2021 we offer our global API on `api.friendlycaptcha.com/api/`.

Before then our documentation and widget distributions would default to `friendlycaptcha.com/api/`.

Only a small subset of our users are still using the old domain. We are starting to actively reach out to those that have not updated since, asking them to make the switch to the `api.friendlycaptcha.com` subdomain.

We are planning to sunset the API endpoints on the old domain entirely. Therefore, action on your part is needed.

## Why?

Serving our API from a separate subdomain allows for better reliability and better privacy preservation.



This change also offers us more flexibility in how we serve our website and apps. It simplifies moving away from a non-EU CDN provider.
